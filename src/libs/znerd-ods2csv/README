This is ods2csv, a Java-based utility for converted ODS-documents to
CSV-text. ODS stands for "OpenDocument Spreadsheet", while CSV means
"Comma-Separated Values".

Note: While the aim is to default to output that is (almost) the same as what
OpenOffice.org produces, this goal is currently not yet achieved.

The converter can be accessed in several ways:

   - directly via the Java class Converter, which takes input from an
     InputStream and produces output via an OutputStream;

   - an Apache Ant task allows easy integration with Ant-based projects;

   - a command line program makes integration with other UNIX-like programs a
     breeze.

This utility program has no external dependencies other than the Java
runtime environment, version 1.5 or higher.

This software requires the following to build (with 'ant jar'):

   - J2SE 1.5 or Java SE 6
   - Ant 1.7.1

To run the unit tests (using 'ant unittests'), the following libraries need to
be in the classpath (or passed with 'ant -lib CLASSPATH'):

   - ant-junit.jar    (tested with Ant 1.7.1)
   - junit.jar        (tested with JUnit 4.0)
   - commons-io.jar   (tested with Commons IO 1.4)

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied LICENSE file.

This task comes as a collection of Java source files that can be built with Ant.
Just run:

   ant

The result will be a JAR file:

   build/ods2csv.jar

Example usage on the command line:

   java -jar build/ods2csv.jar < sheet5.ods > sheet5.csv

Example usage of the task in an Ant build file:

   <taskdef name="ods2csv"
       classname="com.pensioenpage.jynx.ods2csv.ConverterTask"
       classpath="lib/ods2csv.jar" />

   <ods2csv dir="src/ods" todir="build/csv" />

Although all parameters are optional, the task supports various:

   dir      - the source directory, to read ODS files from, defaults to
              the project base directory;

   todir    - the destination directory, to write the generated CSV files to,
              defaults to the source directory;

   includes - the files in the source directory to include, defaults to
              '*.ods';

   excludes - the files to exclude, even if they are matched by the includes;

and other parameters inherited from the MatchingTask, see:
