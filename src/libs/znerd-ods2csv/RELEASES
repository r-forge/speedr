---- VERSION 0.1 (September 1, 2009) -----------------------------------------

Initial release.

CSV output is not perfect, as it contains some superfluous empty cells in each
CSV record and it contains some extra newlines at the end. Also, the output of
numbers, dates and percentages is not completely equivalent to the output
OpenOffice.org produces.
